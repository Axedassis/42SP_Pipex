## Notes


[Symlink] -> is a special type of file that carrie informations of where the real
file/folder is storege. it only point to the path

### Functions that i still dont know

### ERROR FUNTCIONS
the functions works with the global variable [errno] that the value is set by many
other functions whend somehting goes wrong

#### perror
perror -> print a message before print the error message[errno], is way to make the errors more descreptive

```c
void perror(const char *str);
```
print the [str] before the erorr message. This function is particularly useful for debugging when you want to provide context for an error


#### strerror
Unlike perror, strerror doesn't print the error but provides a *string description*, which you can use to *format your custom error messages*.
The error codes like [errno] can be passed directly to [strerror] to get their textual representations.

```c
char *strerror(int errcode);
```

### access

The access function is used to determine the accessibility of a file or directory
by checking specific permission

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int access(const char *pathname, int mode);
```
Constant	        Description
[F_OK]	    Check for the file's existence.
[R_OK]	    Check for read permission.
[W_OK]	    Check for write permission.tituir o programa que 
[X_OK]	    Check for execute/search permission.

we can combine the flags using the operator *OR*( | )

if the returned value is *0* the request access mode is permitted.
if the returned value is *-1* the requst failed and the variable [errno] is set
to be used.

whend a error occurs the [errno] variable is set, some comuns values are

[ENOENT] - File or directory does not exist
[EACCES] - Permision Denied
[EROFS] - Write request in a read-only filesystem

A race condition occurs when a file is *modified* during its [runtime] state while your 
program is simultaneously attempting to perform an operation on it. For example, this 
might happen if your program tries to *write* to a file that is set as *read-only* right after checking its permissions.

To avoid issues caused by race conditions, it is recommended **not** to use functions like access for verifying *permissions* before performing operations. Instead, directly use functions such as open or write, and *handle* any resulting errors appropriately. This approach ensures you can react dynamically to unexpected permission changes or other problems during the file operation

### dup & dup2
are used to duplicate [file_descriptor]

```c
int dup(int oldfd);
```

return the lowest available value to the duplicate descriptor, if has  an error
it return **-1**

already the [[dup2]] is a little more flexible, it allow to choose what gonna be 
the value of the new duplicate descriptor

```c
int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);
```

return tne value of the new file descriptor(newfd) or in case of error it returns
the **-1** 

*!* is insteristing to notice if the value of newfd is already in use it close
and redirect that space to the new fd, instead of dup that is automatically put in
a open space and dont close any file descriptor.


### execve
the function execv make part of a whole family of function [exec], and it is used to replace a program that's been execute by another one, keeping the old process in stand by 

```c
int execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
```

whend the function is called the current programn in process is replaced by a new one indicates by the specifer [path], the old program is discarded by the new one.

[path] the path to the new executable program
[argv] an arry of string that keep the new arguments that is been passed for to the new program
[envp] an array of string represent the arguments to the new programma

if the execv succeeds, nothing after this call will be executed in the old programn

if get a error the retunr is **-1** and the error is set in the [errno]

### fork
The fork function create a duplicate processes from it wa called

```c
#include <unistd.h>

pid_t fork(void);
```
fork do not recive any parms.

the return value made by fork in the parent processes and in the child processes is different

[parent_process] -> the return value is a PID of the [child_processes]
[child_process] -> return 0 with this the code know the processes is running
or **-1** if had an error, and the value is set in [errno]

__how it work__
1. whend the function *fork* is called it create a new process been exactly the
copy of the original processes include the variable values, register and another
resourcers from the processes.

2.after the creation of a main processes copy both one and other (parent and child processes)
still running independent from one to each other (*is possible has shared memory betwenn the processes*)

__uses of fork__
1. the most common use of fork in softwares is to create multiple sub processes to
execute task in parallel. it is way common in server where different processes can
handle with mant different connections

2.in complexy system it can be used to managed N things and execute another independemente
When you invoke multiple fork() calls within a loop or conditional structure, 
you can create a large number of child processes, which can be used for 
high-performance tasks or bulk processing

**COW** a acronym to Copy on Write, initial both the processes share the same 
space on memory, without duplicated, only whend one of the values change as a 
variable change their value is allocated and modify with the new value.

[Orphan_Processes]: An orphan process is a process that loses its parent process. It is adopted by the init process (PID 1).

[Zombie_Processes]: These are processes that have finished executing but the parent process has not called wait() to collect their exit status. The child process still appears in the process table until the parent "reaps" it.

__Orphan Processes__
Occurs when a process loses its parent because tha parent process finishes execution before the child. when this happens, the operating system automatically reassigns the orphaned process to the [init] processe (PDI 1)
__Zombie Processes__
Processes that have finished execution but still occupy an entry in the process table because heir *parent process* has not called **wait()** or **waitpid()**

whend a new process end to take their exit status code we had to use 


```c
int main(void)
{
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0)
    {
        printf("child processes context");
        return (0); //end child processes
    } else
    {
        wait (NULL) //parent waits for child to finishand reaps it;
        printf("Parent reaped the child process\n");
    }
    return (0);
}
```

The parent process calls wait(NULL) to collect the child processâ€™s exit status, preventing it from becoming a zombie

### wait and waitpid

__wait__ 
the wait funtion suspends execution of the calling process until one of its *child* processes terminates.

```c
pid_t wait(int *status);
```

__waitpid__
thw waitpid function provides more control compared to [wait]. It allows waiting for a specific child process or gor processes mathing certain criteria.

```c
pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options);
```
[pid] can hold some values that change their behavior
- *-1* wait for ant child process (same as [wait])
- *>0* wait for the child process with this specific PID
- *< -1* wait for any child process in the process group whose ID is [pid]

[status] pointer to store the child process's status
    to inspect the status we can use macros as  *WIFEXITED*, *WEXITSTATUS*,*WIFSIGNALED*
__WIFEXITED__ -> This macro checks whether the child process exited normally
**True (non-zero)** if the child process exited normally.
**False (zero)** if the child did not terminate normally (e.g., was killed by a signal).

__WEXITSTATUS__
This macro extracts the exit status of a child process that terminated normally. It should only be used if WIFEXITED(status) returns true

[options] modifes the behavior of *waitpid* common option incluse
- *WNOHANG* return immediatly if no child process has exited
- *WUNTRACED* waits for child processes that have stopped

Returns the PID of the terminated or stopped child process.
If no child process has exited, and WNOHANG is specified, it returns 0.
On error, it returns -1.

### pipe
the pipe function handle with the task of create a connection between two different processes that are relationated, as example a parent processes and a child processes 

```c
int pipe(int pipefd[2]);
```

the arguments of pipefd are an array of two integers
- pipefd[0] -> the fd of read file
- pipefd[1] -> the fd of write file

the return value  is is *zero* if everything goes well or *minus one if had an error*
